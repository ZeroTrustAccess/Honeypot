# Azure Honeypot Project 2024

This project involves setting up a honeypot on Microsoft Azure and exposing it to the internet to monitor and analyze potential cyber threats. The goal is to gain insights into the types of attacks that a system may face and use this knowledge to improve system security.

## Project Objectives

- Set up a honeypot on Microsoft Azure.
- Expose the honeypot to the internet.
- Monitor and document any attempted attacks.
- Analyze the data collected by the honeypot.

## High-Level Overview of the Lab
 1. Create a **free Azure account** (which has about $200 in free  credits)
 2. Set up a **Virtual Machine** in Azure.
 3. Turn the external firewall and Windows Firewal off for the VM, exposing it to anyone on the internet to ping and attack.
 4. Create a **Log Repository in Azure** called a **Logs Analystics Workspace**, to ingest the logs from the Virtual Machine.
 5. Set up **Azure Sentinel** with Azure. (Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM)
 6. With that **SIEM**, create a map so that we can see all of the **attacker data**.
 7. Use **Powershell** to extract the IP addresses from the Windows Logs, and send it to a Third Party API, to derive all of the geographic location to be sent back to the Virtual Machine to create a **custom log** of data so we know where these attacks are coming from.

## Getting Started

This lab is documented over the various chapters step-by-step, and can be used in 2024 for you to set up your own Honeypot.

### Prerequisites

- An active Microsoft Azure account.
- Basic knowledge of cybersecurity principles.
