# 🔐 Honeypot Lab

## 📄 Overview
Brief description of the project. What was it about? What tools or skills were used?

This project simulates an attack scenario using a cloud-based honeypot deployed in Microsoft Azure. Logs were analyzed through Sentinel and Splunk to identify malicious behavior and improve incident response skills.
