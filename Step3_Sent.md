# Step 3. SIEM Setup. Microsoft Sentinel

I searched for "sentinel" in the search bar at the top, and chose **Microsoft Sentinel** under *Services*.

This is the **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) tool, that I used to visualize the attack data.

First step of course was to click **Create Microsoft Sentinel**.
