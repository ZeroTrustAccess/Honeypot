# Step 2: Set up the Logs Anyalytics Workspace

The purpose of this is to ingest the logs from the **VM** I created in Step1, to create my own **custom log** that displays the geographic location of the attackers.
- I searched "log" in the search bar at the top to find the link to create my **Logs Analytics Workspace** (which I will refer to as LAW)
