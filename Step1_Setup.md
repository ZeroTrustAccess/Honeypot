# Step 1: Setup

1. Set up a **Virtual Machine**. Look for *Create a resource**, and then find Virtual Machine, and click Virtual Machine. You can also find the Virtual Machine icon from the Home screen, enter it, and then choose **create** in the top left of the menu bar.

There are a variety of ways to get to the same destination. Choose to set up a **Virtual Machine hosted on Azure**.

This will bring you to the **Create a Virtual Machine** page. Next, where it says **Resource Group**, click **create new** and name it something relevant to your project. This allows us to manage our cloud resources as a group instead of individually. For this project, I just called mine *HoneyPot*.

Then give the VM a name: unoriginally, I chose HoneyPotVM.
Next, we must create the **Administrator Account**.
